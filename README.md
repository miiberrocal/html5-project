# 🌮 The Little Taco Shop

A simple static website for "The Little Taco Shop," created to practice HTML5 and CSS skills as part of a web development learning journey. This project was built following the HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro by SuperSimpleDev on YouTube. It features a homepage with a menu and about section, a store hours page, and a contact form page, styled with custom CSS.

## ✨ Features
- Homepage: Introduces The Little Taco Shop with a tasty menu table and taco trivia.
- Store Hours: Lists operating hours using a description list. 
- Contact Us: Includes a form (mock submission to httpbin.org) and contact details. 
- Responsive Navigation: Smooth nav links across pages. 
- Custom Styling: CSS for layouts, images, and a vibrant look.
- Semantic HTML5: Built with modern elements like <nav>, <article>, and <figure>.
